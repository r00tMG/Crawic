## About Project

The SEO Web Application aims to provide users with a powerful tool to discover clean expired domains in any niche. The application  will  run  extensive background checks, ensuring that the domains are free of spammy content, have good authority, and are eligible for registration in private blog networks (PBNs) and other purposes. Below, I present a detailed proposal, including the estimated time and cost for each phase of development.
